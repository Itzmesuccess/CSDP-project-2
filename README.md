# CSDP-project-2


Input: Enter a decimal number when asked. The program will then split the number into integer and fractional parts.

Output: The program will output the binary representation of both the integer and fractional parts separately.


Steps

1. The program reads a decimal number from the user.

3. It splits the number into integer and fractional parts.
   
5. It converts the integer part to binary using a stack data structure.
   
7. It converts the fractional part to binary using a queue data structure.
   
9. The binary representations of both parts are displayed to the user.

File Structure

main.cpp: Contains the main function and user input/output handling.
  
Stack.h and Stack.cpp: Implement a stack data structure for converting the integer part to binary.

Queue.h and Queue.cpp: Implement a queue data structure for converting the fractional part to binary.
